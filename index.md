## About Me

I'm Marlon Calispa, an Environmental Engineer specializing in **soil organic carbon mapping** using remote sensing and GIS. I combine satellite imagery, field sampling, and reproducible workflows to deliver spatially explicit carbon maps for researchers and land managers.

My work focuses on scalable mapping approaches across, bridging the gap between remote sensing technology and practical soil science applications.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Soil Organic Carbon mapping** using satellite data
- **Remote Sensing** applications in environmental science  
- **GIS analysis** and spatial modeling
- **Field sampling** and ground-truth validation
- **R/Python** for geospatial analysis

### Current Focus
Developing reproducible workflows for mapping soil carbon stocks at regional scales, with emphasis on:
- Multi-sensor remote sensing approaches
- Integration of field observations with satellite data
- Open-source tools and methodologies
